lists
=====

These are the sets of solutions to the lists 8, 9, a, b and c, published
at [Jutge.org](http://jutge.org) in the Spring semester of 2012 as a
part of PRO1 course at [Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya](http://upc.edu).

The code is distributed as is. Please do not consider the programming
style a perfect one, I can just say that this was enough to get a good
mark in the course.
